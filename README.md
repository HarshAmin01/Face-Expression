# Face-Expression Prediction and Face Generation

This Deep Learning models predicts the human face expressions based on the image provided in the input section.
Also there are generative models which tries to generates simmilar images based on the provided input.

Predictive Models:
- Predictive models are trained on face expression predictuion part. The basic work flow is that it provides a prediction of a face expression of given images.

- There are three predictive models
  1. Transfer learnt VGGNET19 with additional layers.
  2. Transfer learnt EfficientNet with unfreezing some layers.
  3. Convolution Neural Network.
